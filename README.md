# DeepFake Video Detection

##  Project Description
This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence model that can detect deepfake videos using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The model analyzes and classifies the differences between deepfake and real videos. The dataset used is **[Celeb-DF v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reubensuju/celeb-df-v2)**.

##  Features
- Detection of deepfake videos
- Analysis and classification using a CNN-based deep learning model
- Image processing and artificial intelligence techniques
- Data preprocessing and model training

##  Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **TensorFlow / Keras** 
- **OpenCV** 
- **Scikit-Learn** 
- **NumPy / Pandas** 

##  Dataset
This project uses the **[Celeb-DF v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reubensuju/celeb-df-v2)** dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains deepfake and real videos of celebrities.
